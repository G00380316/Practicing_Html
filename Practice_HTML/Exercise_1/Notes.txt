Let's start by creating a simple page that contains the phrase "Hello, World!" in the body. The page will also have a title - that thing that shows up in the title of the tab in your browser. The <title> element defines the title of the HTML page.

The <!DOCTYPE html> tag defines the document type that the browser is going to render. This is used for legacy reasons. If you want to get to the latest version of HTML (HTML5) then it's recommended to use this tag.

The <p> element defines a "paragraph", a block of text that has a small amount of spacing in between its top and bottom.

Notice how the tags have a start tag and an end tag denoted with a slash (</p>). Everything in between is the content of the tag. The content of a tag can usually have additional HTML tags within them.
