A link ("anchor") is a small span of text that will direct you to a different section in the page, or to a different page. To create a link, you will need to specify where you would like the user to be directed to when the link is clicked by specifying the href attribute.

For example:
<a href="https://www.google.com">A link to Google</a>

To create a link to a different section in the same page, you will need to use a hash sign along with the element ID to where you would like the browser to jump to. For example:

<a href="#faq">Click here to read the Frequently Asked Questions</a>
The element ID is denoted using the id attribute:

<h3 id="faq">Frequently asked questions</h3>
